# Predict Bike Sharing with AutoGluon

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity AWS AI and Machine Learning Fundamentals Nanodegree. It demonstrates how to use AutoGluon, a powerful automated machine learning (AutoML) tool, to build a predictive model for bike-sharing demand. By leveraging AutoGluon's capabilities, the project simplifies the process of developing and optimizing machine learning models.

## Key Features
- **Automated Model Selection**: AutoGluon automatically selects the best model and hyperparameters.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Modify the pipeline to suit different datasets and problem requirements.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Pandas for data handling and Matplotlib for visualization.


## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- AutoGluon
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
